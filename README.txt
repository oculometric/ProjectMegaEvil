we wanna be **MEGA EVILLL** and you know how I do THAT????? I FISH. I GET MY FISHIN' PANTS ON, I GET MY ROD, AND I FISH. 

The fish quiver in fear when they see me coming, my biiiiig roooound belly jiggles as my disproportionately teeny tiny feet stomp on the ground hopping into my boat.
They try to flee but I've already gotten them in my sight.... They won't escape me once i cast my rod, my fine lures being too tantilizing to resist, i've already gotten them in my trap.
i shake my arms around a lot once they bite down, left, right, left, right click! click! click! (?)

after i've tired the fish out, it finally leaps from the water at my pull and OMFGGGGGGG IS THAT A FUCKING KRACKENDEUFGISGFED7UGFUSFCBGDEFG OH SHIT OH GOD OH NO OH NO
The kracken lands on top of me as my big arms are unable to withstand it's weight. YYYYYYYEOUCH!!!!!!! 





i'm flat now.
